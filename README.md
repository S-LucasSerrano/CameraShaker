# Camera Shaker
``2.1``

A simple and easy-to-use Unity component to add juice and game feel to your games. This component shakes the camera using, instead of just random directions, the direction extracted from a perlin noise map. Making each movement feel more connected to the next one, and the shake overall, more fiscal and organic.

It was made following the tips of this amazing talk by Squirrel Eiserloh: [Watch the youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu-Qe66AvtY&list=PLBJR0H4rFtvNiYaPg23POOJRNl3oXZZJ0&index=4&t=295s).

This repository includes a Unity Package file (.unitypackage) and a sample project that lets you test out the possibilities that it offers. You only need to download the Unity Package (.unitypackage) to import it into your project.

See everything this component can do and how to use it on the documentation, here: [S-LucasSerrano/CameraShaker/wiki](https://github.com/S-LucasSerrano/CameraShaker/wiki#camera-shaker--by-s-lucas-serrano)

You can play with the sample project directly from your browser on the itch.io page of the asset: [See on Itch.io](https://lucasserrano.itch.io/camerashaker).
